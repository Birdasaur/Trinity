**Explainable AI (XAI) Analysis and Visualization tool**

Trinity provides performance analysis and XAI tools ideal for Deep Learning systems or other models performing complex 
classification or decoding. 
Trinity does this through a combination of different interactive 3D projections that are hyper-dimensional aware. (Vectors of Vectors)

Trinity's Hyperspace view provides a 3D scatter plot with automatic 2D projections of feature/factor data. 
The dimensional combinations can be instantly switched to rapidly search through hyper-dimensional space.
The user can pan, rotate and zoom either the 3D camera or the points themselves. 
The scatter points are interactive allowing the user to select individual points to bring up the associated data/imagery with that feature.

Trinity provides a fast parallelized UMAP tool with a simple to use GUI to project the hyper-dimensional embeddings
down to an arbitrary lower dimensional space. This allows analysts to project approximate manifolds as 3D clusters.
