# Trinity

**Visualization tool for hyperdimensional data.**

Trinity provides a 3D scatter plot with automatic 2D projections of feature/factor data typically derived from neural inspired systems such as deep learning neural networks and biological neuronal firings. The primary visual view is through its _Hyperspace_ view which presents  a 3D scatter plot of the current hyperdimensions and allows the user to instantly shift, slide or select which indices within the hyperspace to use for the scatterplot. The 2D permutations of 3D view are automatically projected as 2D plots within the same view on to the sides of plotting cube.
The 3D scene is interactive. The user can pan, rotate and zoom either the 3D camera or the points themselves. The scatter points are interactive allowing the user to select individual points to bring up the associated data/imagery with that feature.
